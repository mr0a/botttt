## User Stories - Trade Execution & Risk Management

### 2.5 Trade Execution & Risk Management
* As an individual trader, I want my automated strategies to initiate trade orders when their conditions are met, so that the application can execute trades either with a real broker or in paper trading mode.
* As an individual trader, I expect real money trading to store trades in the database and also make API calls to the stock broker, so that my trades are accurately executed and recorded.
* As an individual trader, I want my strategies to include defined exit points and stop-loss logic, so that positions are managed and potential losses are contained.
* As an individual trader, I want my strategies to continuously monitor real-time prices against their defined exit and stop-loss levels, so that timely actions can be taken.
* As an individual trader, I want the application to dynamically reduce my position size if price movement does not confirm my strategy's conditions or if market volatility significantly increases, so that I can manage risk in adverse conditions.
* As an individual trader, I want the application to automatically place a Good Till Triggered (GTT) order at a market price with a safety stop limit, so that a protective measure is always in place for my positions.
* As an individual trader, I want the application to actively monitor the price relative to the GTT order's stop limit, so that it can place a precise stop-limit order when the price is near my desired stop loss.
* As an individual trader, I want the application to automatically cancel the corresponding GTT order once my position is closed, so that stale orders do not remain.
* As an individual trader, I expect the application to store orders and their statuses in the database, and maintain current positions in application memory for quick access.

## Functional Requirements - Trade Execution & Risk Management

### 3.5 Trade Execution & Risk Management

**1. Order Initiation & Management:**
* **FR.ER.1.1**: Strategies **MUST** be able to initiate trade orders (buy/sell) when their internal conditions are met.
* **FR.ER.1.2**: The application **MUST** support initiating both **limit orders** (as primary) and **market orders** (as an option) from strategies.
* **FR.ER.1.3**: The application **MUST** store all initiated orders and their current statuses (e.g., pending, filled, cancelled, rejected) in the database.
* **FR.ER.1.4**: In live trading, the application **MUST** make API calls to the configured broker for actual order placement and receive status updates.

**2. Real-time Position & Data Handling:**
* **FR.ER.2.1**: The application **MUST** maintain all current open positions in memory for low-latency access and real-time monitoring.
* **FR.ER.2.2**: The application **MUST** continuously receive real-time data (ticks, order flow) via WebSocket from the broker, storing it both in memory and persistently in the database.

**3. Strategy-Driven Risk Control:**
* **FR.ER.3.1**: Strategies **MUST** be able to define and implement their own exit points and stop-loss logic.
* **FR.ER.3.2**: The application **MUST** continuously monitor real-time prices against the defined exit points and stop-loss levels within active strategies.
* **FR.ER.3.3**: The application **MUST** dynamically reduce existing position size if a strategy detects that market price movement does not confirm its initial entry conditions or if market volatility significantly increases (based on strategy-defined criteria).

**4. Advanced Stop-Loss Mechanism:**
* **FR.ER.4.1**: The application **MUST** automatically place a Good Till Triggered (GTT) order with the broker, set at a price level below the strategy's defined stop-loss, to act as a safety net.
* **FR.ER.4.2**: The application **MUST** actively monitor the real-time price as it approaches the strategy's stop-loss level.
* **FR.ER.4.3**: When the real-time price is near the strategy's stop-loss level, the application **MUST** attempt to close the position (e.g., by placing a market or stop-limit order) as quickly as possible.
* **FR.ER.4.4**: In the event that the application's primary attempt to close the position at stop-loss fails or is not executed for any reason, the pre-placed GTT order **MUST** trigger to ensure the position is closed, preventing further loss.
* **FR.ER.4.5**: Upon successful closure of a position (either by the application's primary action or the GTT trigger), the application **MUST** automatically cancel the corresponding GTT order to prevent unintended future execution.
* **FR.ER.4.6**: In the event of a broker data feed issue or disconnection (e.g., no data received), the application **MUST** display an immediate notification in the web application's UI.
* **FR.ER.4.7**: In the event of a broker data feed issue or disconnection where data is not being received, the application **MUST** automatically attempt to close all open positions to prevent further losses.

## Trading Execution Architecture

### Order Management System
The application **MUST** implement a comprehensive order management system with the following components:

#### Order Types
* **Market Orders** - Immediate execution at current market price
* **Limit Orders** - Execution at specified price or better
* **Stop-Loss Orders** - Risk management exits
* **Good Till Triggered (GTT)** - Safety net orders

#### Order Lifecycle
1. **Order Creation** - Strategy generates order request
2. **Order Validation** - Risk checks and parameter validation
3. **Order Submission** - Send to broker (live) or simulate (paper)
4. **Order Monitoring** - Track status and fill confirmations
5. **Order Management** - Modify, cancel, or close orders

#### Order Status Tracking
* **Pending** - Order submitted, awaiting execution
* **Filled** - Order executed completely
* **Partially Filled** - Order executed partially
* **Cancelled** - Order cancelled before execution
* **Rejected** - Order rejected by broker or system
* **Expired** - Order expired before execution

### Position Management System

#### Real-time Position Tracking
* **In-Memory Storage** - Current positions for low-latency access
* **Database Persistence** - Complete position history and audit trail
* **Position Reconciliation** - Sync between memory and broker positions

#### Position Risk Monitoring
* **Continuous Price Monitoring** - Real-time P&L calculations
* **Stop-Loss Tracking** - Monitor against strategy-defined levels
* **Volatility Assessment** - Dynamic risk adjustment triggers
* **Position Sizing** - Dynamic adjustment based on market conditions

### Multi-layered Risk Management

#### Layer 1: Strategy-Level Risk Controls
* **Entry Validation** - Strategy-specific entry criteria
* **Position Sizing** - Risk-based quantity calculation

#### Layer 2: Application-Level Risk Controls
* **Real-time Monitoring** - Continuous price and position tracking
