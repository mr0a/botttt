* **NFR.M.1.2 (Modular Strategies & Analytics)**: The framework for defining strategies and analytical components **MUST** follow clear abstractions and design patterns, facilitating the addition, modification, and maintenance of new strategies and analytical methods.

**2. Code Quality:**
* **NFR.M.1.3 (Code Quality)**: The codebase **SHOULD** adhere to established coding standards and be well-documented to ensure long-term maintainability.

## Technology Stack & Constraints

### 5.1 Mandatory Technology Requirements

**1. Database & Storage:**

**2. Frontend Technologies:**
* **CO.1.3 (Technology Stack - Preferred)**: The application **MUST** utilize TradingView Lightweight Charts for all charting functionalities.
* **CO.1.6 (Frontend Framework)**: The frontend user interface **MUST** be developed using the Svelte framework.

**3. Architecture Requirements:**
* **CO.1.5 (Technical Architecture)**: The core application **MUST** be developed with an asynchronous execution model, prioritizing low latency, best possible performance, and strong type support.

### 5.2 Deployment & Environment Constraints

**1. Timeline Constraints:**
* **CO.1.1 (POC Timeline)**: A Proof of Concept (POC) for the application **MUST** be developed and demonstrated within a one-week timeframe.

**2. Infrastructure Requirements:**
* **CO.1.2 (Deployment Environment)**: The application **MUST** be deployable and run effectively within a VPS environment.

## Dependencies & External Requirements

### 6.1 Critical Dependencies

**1. Broker Integration:**
