## User Stories - Data Ingestion & Viewing

### 2.1 Data Ingestion & Viewing
* As an individual trader, I want the application to collect real-time tick-by-tick data, order flow, and depth information from my stock broker, so that I have the raw data for granular analysis.
* As an individual trader, I want the application to aggregate tick data into second-level and minute-level timeframes, so that I can perform analysis at different resolutions, especially during volatile market conditions.
* As an individual trader, I want the application to store all collected and aggregated data in a database, so that it can be reliably accessed for analysis, backtesting, and visualization.
* As an individual trader, I want the web application to display real-time and historical price, order flow, and aggregated data, so that I can visually understand market movements and inform my strategy decisions.
* As an individual trader, I want the web application to provide visualization tools for the collected data, so that I can easily identify patterns and insights to improve my trading strategies.
* As an individual trader, I want the application to run a specific job on startup to fetch necessary data from the broker, so that the application is initialized with the required information before trading begins.

## Functional Requirements - Data Layer

### 3.1 Data Ingestion & Viewing

**1. Broker Connectivity & Initialization:**
* **FR.DI.1.1**: The application **MUST** be designed with a broker-agnostic architecture, allowing for connection to various stock brokers.
* **FR.DI.1.2**: The application **MUST** support connectivity to brokers via REST API for tasks such as fetching historical data, placing orders, and querying account information.
* **FR.DI.1.3**: The application **MUST** support connectivity to brokers via WebSocket for real-time data streams (tick, order flow, depth).
* **FR.DI.1.4**: The application **MUST** provide a clear interface (e.g., a modular client structure) that allows new broker integrations to be written and connected without modifying core application logic.
* **FR.DI.1.5**: On application startup, a background job **MUST** automatically fetch an updated list of tradable instruments from the configured broker(s).
* **FR.DI.1.6**: On application startup, the background job **MUST** update the status of expired instruments in the system based on data from the broker.
* **FR.DI.1.7**: On application startup, the background job **MUST** obtain and manage an authentication token from the broker for subsequent API interactions.
* **FR.DI.1.8**: The application **MUST** securely store broker credentials to facilitate automatic authentication and connection for data feeds and trade execution.

**2. Data Point Capture & Storage:**
* **FR.DI.2.1**: The application **MUST** capture and store real-time tick-by-tick data.
    * *Elaboration on Data Points for Tick Data*: Timestamp, Instrument Identifier, Price, Quantity, Trade ID (if provided by broker), Exchange.
* **FR.DI.2.2**: The application **MUST** capture and store real-time order flow (level 2) or depth information.
    * *Elaboration on Data Points for Order Flow/Depth Data*: Timestamp, Instrument Identifier, Bid Price, Bid Quantity, Ask Price, Ask Quantity, Bid Levels (Price/Quantity), Ask Levels (Price/Quantity), Order ID (if applicable).
* **FR.DI.2.3**: The application **MUST** use PostgreSQL with the TimescaleDB extension for all data storage.
* **FR.DI.2.4**: All raw tick data and depth data **MUST** be stored persistently in the database to support comprehensive backtesting.
* **FR.DI.2.5**: The application **MUST** implement a data archiving mechanism to manage storage by moving or deleting old historical data after a configurable interval.

**3. Data Aggregation & Access:**
* **FR.DI.3.1**: The application **MUST** aggregate incoming tick data into second-level OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) candles in real-time.
* **FR.DI.3.2**: Upon completion of each 5-minute interval, the application **MUST** use the corresponding second-level candles to generate a 5-minute OHLC candle.
* **FR.DI.3.3**: The application **MUST** support dynamic aggregation of data into various other timeframes (e.g., 1-minute, 15-minute) based on the requirements of active strategies and chosen instruments.
* **FR.DI.3.4**: The application **MUST** expose an API to serve real-time and historical aggregated candle data, order flow, and depth data to the web application.

## Related Technical Specifications

### Performance Requirements
* **NFR.P.1.2 (Data Throughput)**: The application **MUST** be capable of processing approximately 10 real-time WebSocket messages per second per instrument.

### Scalability Requirements
* **NFR.S.1.1 (Instrument Capacity)**: The application **MUST** support monitoring and trading for up to 500 distinct instruments without significant performance degradation.
* **NFR.S.1.3 (Data Volume Growth)**: The data storage solution **MUST** be able to accommodate the continuous influx of tick and depth data for the specified number of instruments over time, with archiving capabilities to manage long-term storage.

### Reliability Requirements
* **NFR.R.1.3 (Data Integrity)**: The application **MUST** ensure the integrity of stored data, especially trade records and position states, even in the event of system failures.

### Security Requirements
* **NFR.SE.1.3 (Data Protection)**: Sensitive data, including broker credentials and trade history, **MUST** be protected both at rest (e.g., encryption for database fields) and in transit (e.g., using HTTPS/WSS for API communication).

### Dependencies
* **DP.1.1 (Broker APIs/Data Feeds)**: The application is dependent on the availability and functionality of the chosen stock broker's REST APIs and WebSocket data feeds.
* **DP.1.3 (PostgreSQL & TimescaleDB)**: The data storage and retrieval capabilities are dependent on the stability and performance of PostgreSQL with the TimescaleDB extension.

### Constraints
* **CO.1.4 (Technology Stack - Preferred)**: The application **MUST** use PostgreSQL with the TimescaleDB extension for all time-series data storage.
