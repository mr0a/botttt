> **Navigation:** [Data Layer](prd-data-layer.md) | [Analysis & UI](prd-analysis-ui.md) | [Strategy Engine](prd-strategy-engine.md) | [Trading Execution](prd-trading-execution.md) | [Technical Specs](prd-technical-specs.md)

## 1. Project Brief

### 1.1 Problem Statement:
Individual traders lack a robust, low-latency application that combines real-time data analysis with automated, flexible, and risk-managed trade execution capabilities for intraday trading.

### 1.2 Proposed Solution:
Develop a high-performance, real-time analysis and trading application designed for individual traders. This application will:
* Ingest tick-by-tick data, order flow, and depth information from stock brokers.
* Provide robust analytical capabilities including technical indicators, pattern recognition, and statistical analysis.
* Enable users to define and automate their trading strategies using the application's native language, with support for specifying data timeframes and managing multiple instruments within a single strategy.
* Implement advanced risk management features, including continuous position monitoring, dynamic position size reduction based on adverse price movements or counter-position analysis, mandated stop-loss orders for all positions, and market selling as a fallback if stop-loss orders are not executed.
* Provide a User Interface (UI) for viewing analysis and detailed analytical information.
* Allow users to backtest strategies using historical data and conduct live testing (paper trading) without using real money.

### 1.3 Target Audience:
Individual traders focused on intraday trading, with trade durations typically ranging from 1 to 15 minutes. Users will utilize the application for both data analysis and the automation of their trading strategies.

### 1.4 Key Features & Capabilities (High-Level):

* **Real-time Data Ingestion**: Tick-by-tick, Order Flow, Market Depth.
* **Advanced Analytics Engine**: Technical Indicators, Pattern Recognition, Statistical Analysis, Market Movement Summaries, Price Reaction at Levels.
* **Flexible Strategy Automation**: Code-based strategies, custom timeframes, multi-instrument support, configurable parameters, live/paper mode specification.
* **Strategy Validation**: Backtesting with historical data, Paper Trading without real money.
* **Robust Risk Management**: Continuous position monitoring, dynamic position sizing, advanced stop-loss mechanisms (GTT + active monitoring), fallback to market execution.
* **User Interface (UI)**: Interactive charts (TradingView-like), visualization of analysis details, trade lists for live execution.
* **Performance**: Low-latency execution (under 300ms).
* **Broker Agnostic**: Interface for connecting to different brokers.
* **Application Management**: Scheduled tasks, automatic broker authentication.

### 1.5 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs - To be further defined):

* Latency of data processing and trade execution (specifically under 300ms).
* Reliability/Uptime of data feeds and trading engine.
* Accuracy of analytical outputs.
* Effectiveness of risk management mechanisms in preventing catastrophic losses.

2. **[Analysis & UI](prd-analysis-ui.md)** - Visualization, charting, and web application features  
3. **[Strategy Engine](prd-strategy-engine.md)** - Strategy creation, management, backtesting, and paper trading
4. **[Trading Execution](prd-trading-execution.md)** - Risk management, order execution, and position monitoring
5. **[Technical Specs](prd-technical-specs.md)** - Non-functional requirements, constraints, and dependencies

Each document contains detailed functional requirements, user stories, and specifications for its respective domain.
