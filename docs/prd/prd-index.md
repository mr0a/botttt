## 🏗️ Development Workflow Benefits

### **Parallel Development**
- **Data Team**: Focus on [`prd-data-layer.md`](prd-data-layer.md) for broker integrations and storage
- **Frontend Team**: Concentrate on [`prd-analysis-ui.md`](prd-analysis-ui.md) for visualization features
- **Algorithm Team**: Develop using [`prd-strategy-engine.md`](prd-strategy-engine.md) specifications
- **Trading Team**: Implement [`prd-trading-execution.md`](prd-trading-execution.md) risk management

### **Reduced Merge Conflicts**
- Separate files minimize collision during concurrent updates
- Domain-specific changes isolated to relevant documents
- Clear ownership boundaries for different development streams

### **Focused Reviews**
- Stakeholders review only relevant sections
- Domain experts validate specific functional areas
- Faster approval cycles for individual components

## 📝 Document Maintenance

### Version Control
- Each shard maintains independent versioning
- Cross-references updated when dependencies change
- Master index updated for structural changes

### Review Process
1. **Domain Expert Review**: Relevant stakeholders validate their specific documents
2. **Integration Review**: Architect validates cross-document consistency
3. **Technical Review**: System requirements validated against implementation feasibility

### Update Workflow
1. Identify affected documents for any requirement change
2. Update primary document with detailed changes
3. Update cross-references in dependent documents
4. Validate integration points remain consistent
