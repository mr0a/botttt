## User Stories - Strategy Creation & Management

### 2.3 Strategy Creation & Management
* As a developer, I want to define each trading strategy as a separate code class, so that strategies are modular, maintainable, and easily extendable within the application's codebase.
* As an individual trader, I want the application to load all available strategies on startup, so that they are ready for use during live trading or testing.
* As an individual trader, I want to configure the specific instruments (single or multiple) that a strategy will monitor and trade, so that I can apply my strategy to the desired assets.
* As an individual trader, I want to configure various parameters for each strategy, so that I can customize its behavior without modifying the core strategy code.
* As an individual trader, I want to be able to explicitly specify whether a strategy should execute trades in a live (real money) environment or a paper trading (simulated) environment, so that I have control over the risk level of each strategy.
* As an individual trader, I want to be able to enable or disable specific strategies directly within the application's code, so that I have fine-grained control over which strategies are active.
* As an individual trader, I want an API endpoint to enable or disable strategies programmatically, so that I can dynamically control strategy activation without restarting the application.

### 2.4 Backtesting & Paper Trading
* As an individual trader, I want to initiate a backtest for a chosen strategy directly from the web application, so that I can evaluate its historical performance.
* As an individual trader, I want to specify the strategy parameters and the date range for a backtest within the web application, so that I can configure the test precisely.
* As an individual trader, I want to view the analysis, simulated trades, and overall results of a backtest within the web application, so that I can understand how my strategy performed historically.
* As an individual trader, I want to initiate a paper trading session for a strategy directly within the application's code, so that I can test its real-time behavior without financial risk.
* As an individual trader, I want to monitor the activity and simulated trades of a paper trading session within the web application, so that I can observe its performance in a live, risk-free environment.
* As an individual trader, I expect paper trading to simulate trade fills based on the Last Traded Price (LTP) received from the real-time data feed (assuming a broker is always present for data).
* As an individual trader, I expect paper trading to simulate trade execution by storing trades in the database without making actual calls to a stock broker, so that I can test strategies safely.

## Functional Requirements - Strategy Engine

### 3.3 Strategy Creation & Management

* **FR.SM.1.2**: The application **MUST** provide a mechanism (e.g., code-based registration in a central file or through decorators if supported by the language/framework) to register strategies, including their configurable parameters and their default trading mode (live/paper).
* **FR.SM.1.3**: The application **MUST** load all registered strategies on startup, making them available for execution or testing.

**2. Strategy Configuration:**
* **FR.SM.2.1**: The application **MUST** enable configuration of strategy-specific parameters via external configuration files, supporting both YAML and JSON formats.
* **FR.SM.2.2**: The application **MUST** allow configuration of the specific instruments (single or multiple) that a strategy will monitor and trade, primarily through these configuration files.
* **FR.SM.2.3**: The application **MUST** allow explicit specification of a strategy's default execution mode (live or paper trading) within its configuration.
* **FR.SM.2.4**: The application **MUST** support initial database population or updates from external data sources (e.g., broker-provided YAML or CSV files) for elements like instrument lists.

**3. Strategy Control & Lifecycle:**
* **FR.SM.3.1**: The application **MUST** allow enabling or disabling specific strategies programmatically within the application's source code.
* **FR.SM.3.2**: The application **MUST** expose REST API endpoints to dynamically enable or disable specific strategies at runtime without requiring application restart.

### 3.4 Backtesting & Paper Trading

**1. Backtesting Core Functionality:**
* **FR.BP.1.1**: The web application **MUST** communicate with the backend via REST API to initiate backtesting sessions for a selected strategy.
* **FR.BP.1.2**: The web application **MUST** allow the user to specify strategy parameters and a precise date range for backtesting.
* **FR.BP.1.3**: The backend **MUST** execute the backtest using historical data stored in the database.
* **FR.BP.1.4**: The web application **MUST** display comprehensive backtest results, including:
    * Overall profit factor.
    * Number of winning trades.
    * Number of losing trades.
    * Detailed information for each simulated trade (e.g., entry/exit price, time, quantity, profit/loss).

**2. Paper Trading Core Functionality:**
* **FR.BP.2.1**: The application **MUST** allow for the initiation of a paper trading session for a strategy directly within the application's code.
* **FR.BP.2.2**: The web application **MUST** provide a dashboard or section to monitor the activity and simulated trades of ongoing paper trading sessions.
* **FR.BP.2.3**: During paper trading, the application **MUST** simulate trade fills based on the Last Traded Price (LTP) received from the real-time data feed (assuming a broker is always present for data).
* **FR.BP.2.4**: During paper trading, the application **MUST** store all simulated trades and their statuses in the database, without making any calls to a real broker.
* **FR.BP.2.5**: The web application **MUST** provide controls (e.g., buttons or toggles) to enable or disable individual strategies when operating in paper trading mode.

## Strategy Architecture Requirements

### Strategy Class Structure
Each trading strategy **MUST** implement the following core components:

#### Required Methods
* **`initialize()`** - Strategy setup and parameter validation
* **`on_data()`** - Process incoming market data and generate signals
* **`on_trade()`** - Handle trade execution confirmations
* **`calculate_position_size()`** - Determine trade quantities
* **`should_exit()`** - Evaluate exit conditions
* **`get_stop_loss()`** - Define stop-loss levels

#### Configuration Interface
* **Instrument List** - Single or multiple instruments to monitor
* **Timeframe Settings** - Data aggregation preferences
* **Risk Parameters** - Position sizing, stop-loss rules
* **Strategy Parameters** - Custom indicators, thresholds, logic settings
* **Execution Mode** - Live trading vs. paper trading specification

#### Data Access Interface
* **Real-time Market Data** - Access to tick, candle, and depth data
* **Historical Data** - Backtesting data retrieval
* **Technical Indicators** - Built-in and custom analytical functions
* **Market Context** - Previous day levels, key technical levels

### Strategy Registration System

* **Real-time Feeds** - Tick data, order flow, market depth
* **Aggregated Data** - OHLC candles at various timeframes
* **Historical Data** - For backtesting and lookback calculations
* **Market Context** - Previous levels, volatility measures

### Strategy Output Integration
Strategy outputs integrate with other system components:

* **[Analysis & UI](prd-analysis-ui.md)** - Visualization of strategy signals and states
* **[Trading Execution](prd-trading-execution.md)** - Order generation and position management
* **Database Storage** - Trade records, performance metrics, configuration history

## Related Technical Specifications

### Performance Requirements
* **NFR.P.1.4 (Concurrency)**: The backend system **MUST** support the concurrent operation of 30-40 active strategies with minimal performance degradation.

### Maintainability Requirements
* **NFR.M.1.2 (Modular Strategies & Analytics)**: The framework for defining strategies and analytical components **MUST** follow clear abstractions and design patterns, facilitating the addition, modification, and maintenance of new strategies and analytical methods.
