## User Stories - Analysis & Visualization

### 2.2 Analysis & Visualization
* As an individual trader, I want to view real-time and historical market data on an interactive chart similar to TradingView, so that I can visually analyze price movements and identify patterns.
* As an individual trader developing or paper-trading a strategy, I want the chart to display the values calculated by my strategy (e.g., indicator lines, entry/exit signals), so that I can visually debug and refine my strategy's logic.
* As an individual trader developing or paper-trading a strategy, I want to see specific numerical values calculated by my strategy alongside the chart, so that I can precisely understand its internal state and decision-making process.
* As an individual trader, I want the analyses (technical indicators, patterns, statistical results) to be consumable by my automated strategies, so that the strategies can use these insights to execute trades.
* As an individual trader in live execution mode, I want to view a concise list of executed trades and their corresponding values (e.g., price, time, profit/loss) in the web application, so that I can monitor my live positions without detailed analytical visualizations.
* As an individual trader, I want the application to analyze and present a summary of market movements (e.g., opening gap, movement towards indicators, range-bound periods, closing change), so that I can quickly grasp the day's or period's price action.
* As an individual trader, I want the application to identify and display how price reacts at significant levels, such as previous day's high/low, all-time high/low, and other key technical levels, so that I can understand the market's behavior around critical points.

## Functional Requirements - Analysis & Visualization

### 3.2 Analysis & Visualization (UI Focus)

**1. Core Data Visualization:**
* **FR.AV.1.1**: The web application **MUST** display real-time and historical candle data using an interactive candlestick chart, leveraging the TradingView Lightweight Charts library.
* **FR.AV.1.2**: The web application **MUST** display real-time order flow and depth information in a distinct box format, showing current price, quantity, and indicators of directional movement.
* **FR.AV.1.3**: The web application **MUST** provide user interface controls for navigating (e.g., zoom, pan) historical data on charts.

**2. Advanced Visualization Features:**
* **FR.AV.2.1**: The web application **MUST** allow users to draw lines and boxes on the charts as extensions to the TradingView Lightweight Charts library.
* **FR.AV.2.2**: The web application **MUST** visualize Open Interest (OI) data in dedicated charts.
* **FR.AV.2.3**: The web application **MUST** allow users to select multiple strike prices for an instrument and display their combined Open Interest on the OI chart.

**3. Market Movement & Level Reaction Analysis Visualization:**
* **FR.AV.3.1**: The web application **MUST** display a summary of analyzed market movements for a selected period (e.g., "Price started 0.2% low, moved till 50EMA, moved in a range, ended at 0.1%").
* **FR.AV.3.2**: The web application **MUST** highlight or annotate on charts and/or in a dedicated summary how price reacted at significant levels (e.g., Previous Day High/Low, All-Time High/Low, and other key technical levels).

## Related Technical Specifications

### Performance Requirements
* **NFR.P.1.3 (UI Responsiveness)**: The web application's UI **MUST** provide continuous, real-time updates to charts and data displays with minimal perceived lag, ensuring a smooth user experience, particularly during volatile market conditions.
* **NFR.P.1.5 (UI Interaction Latency)**: UI interactions (e.g., loading charts, applying filters) **SHOULD** respond quickly to user input to maintain intuitiveness.

### Usability Requirements
* **NFR.U.1.1 (Intuitiveness)**: The web application UI **MUST** be intuitive and easy for individual traders to learn and use, minimizing the learning curve for core functionalities.
* **NFR.U.1.2 (Feedback)**: The application **SHOULD** provide clear and timely feedback to the user on system status, strategy activity, and trade outcomes.

### Dependencies
* **DP.1.2 (TradingView Lightweight Charts Library)**: The frontend visualization is dependent on the features and stability of the TradingView Lightweight Charts library.

### Constraints
* **CO.1.3 (Technology Stack - Preferred)**: The application **MUST** utilize TradingView Lightweight Charts for all charting functionalities.
* **CO.1.6 (Frontend Framework)**: The frontend user interface **MUST** be developed using the Svelte framework.

## Data Requirements for UI

The Analysis & UI layer requires the following data from the [Data Layer](prd-data-layer.md):

### Real-time Data Feeds
* **Tick-by-tick data** for live chart updates
* **Order flow and depth information** for market depth visualization
* **Aggregated candle data** (second-level, minute-level, custom timeframes)

### Historical Data Access
* **Historical candle data** for chart navigation and backtesting visualization
* **Historical trade data** for performance analysis displays
* **Market level data** for technical analysis overlays

### Strategy Data Integration
* **Strategy calculation outputs** for indicator overlays on charts
* **Entry/exit signals** for visual debugging
* **Strategy state information** for numerical displays
* **Trade execution data** for live monitoring lists

## UI Component Architecture

### Core Charting Components
* **Interactive Candlestick Chart** (TradingView Lightweight Charts)
* **Real-time Order Flow Display** (custom box format)
* **Chart Navigation Controls** (zoom, pan, timeframe selection)
* **Drawing Tools** (lines, boxes, annotations)

### Analysis Display Components
* **Market Movement Summary Panel**
* **Level Reaction Analysis Display**
* **Open Interest Charts** (multi-strike visualization)
* **Strategy Indicator Overlays**

### Trading Monitoring Components
* **Live Trade List** (concise format for execution mode)
* **Strategy State Display** (numerical values and status)
* **System Status Indicators** (data feeds, strategy activity)
