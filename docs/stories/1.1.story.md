## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story exists - this is the first story in the project.

### Technology Stack Context
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Runtime Environment:**
- **Primary Runtime**: Bun (fastest JS runtime with native TypeScript support)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x for type safety and maintainability
- **Package Manager**: Bun for ultra-fast package installation and management

**Backend Technologies:**
- **Framework**: ElysiaJS (high-performance HTTP server, built for Bun)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with TimescaleDB 2.x for time-series optimization
- **DB Driver**: Bun's built-in postgres driver
- **Dependency Injection**: InversifyJS for modularity and testability

**Frontend Technologies:**
- **Framework**: Svelte 5 with Runes for compiled output and excellent performance
- **Charts**: TradingView Lightweight Charts for financial data visualization
- **UI Library**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first design system
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

**Development & Operations:**
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose for consistent environments
- **Process Manager**: Systemd for production, Bun PM for development
- **Testing**: Bun Test + Playwright for native testing and E2E testing
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics and visualization

### Project Structure and File Locations
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**File Organization:**
```
src/
 ├── trading/           # Trading logic modules
 ├── strategies/        # Strategy implementations (.strategy.ts suffix)
 ├── brokers/          # Broker client implementations (.client.ts suffix)
 ├── api/              # api server
 └── components/       # Shared components
```

**Naming Conventions:**
- Files: kebab-case (e.g., `order-manager.ts`)
- Classes: PascalCase
- Strategy files: `.strategy.ts` suffix
- Client files: `.client.ts` suffix

### Performance Requirements
[Source: architecture/index.md, architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Critical Performance Targets:**
- Order Execution Latency: < 300ms end-to-end
- Data Processing Time: < 50ms per WebSocket message to database write
- UI Response Time: < 100ms for user interactions
- Concurrent Strategies: Support for 30-40 active strategy instances
- Instrument Capacity: Monitor 500+ trading instruments

### Core Dependencies
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Production Dependencies:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@elysiajs/elysia": "^1.0.0",
    "inversify": "^6.0.0",
    "reflect-metadata": "^0.1.13",
    "postgres": "^3.4.0",
    "winston": "^3.10.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^20.0.0",
    "playwright": "^1.40.0",
    "typescript": "^5.2.0"
  }
}
```

### Environment Configuration Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Required Environment Setup:**
- Docker containers for PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB
- Environment variables for database connection
- TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- JWT configuration for authentication
- Secrets management for broker credentials

**Security Requirements:**
- Non-root container execution
- Encrypted credential storage
- Network isolation with minimal exposed ports
- Input validation and sanitization

### Development Workflow
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Local Development Setup:**
- Bun runtime (same as production)
- Docker Compose for local service orchestration
- Hot reload for fast development iteration
- Mock brokers for testing without live market data

**Code Standards Enforcement:**
- ESLint configuration with custom rules for trading-specific patterns
- Pre-commit hooks for type checking and formatting
- Automated testing requirements for critical trading logic
- Performance monitoring from day one

### Architecture Constraints
[Source: architecture/index.md, architecture/main-application-architecture.md]

**Core Architectural Decisions:**
- Monolithic Modular Design: Single application with clear component separation
- Event-Driven Processing: Asynchronous message handling for optimal throughput
- In-Memory Computing: Critical data cached for ultra-fast access
- Broker-Agnostic: Generic interfaces supporting multiple trading platforms
- Operational Isolation: Separate entry points for different operational modes

**Integration Points to Document:**
- Data Ingestion ↔ Database Schema: Real-time data storage patterns
- Strategy Engine ↔ API Specs: Strategy control endpoints
- Trading Engine ↔ Risk Manager: Position validation and monitoring
- External Operations ↔ Monitoring: Health checks and alerting

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Unit Test Requirements:**
- Use Bun Test as the native test runner
- Test critical business logic with specific financial scenarios
- Test edge cases for financial calculations (zero prices, negative amounts)
- Validate error handling for trading operations
- Test performance critical code paths

**Integration Test Requirements:**
- Use Playwright for E2E testing of complete workflows
- Test with realistic market data sequences
- Validate complete trading cycles from signal to execution
- Test database operations and data persistence

**Test File Organization:**
- Unit tests: Co-located with source files using `.test.ts` suffix
- Integration tests: Separate `tests/integration/` directory
- E2E tests: Separate `tests/e2e/` directory

**Performance Testing:**
- Validate latency requirements (< 300ms order execution)
- Test memory usage patterns for 24h continuous operation
- Benchmark tick processing performance (< 50ms per tick)
