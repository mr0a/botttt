# Realtime Analysis and Trading Application UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Realtime Analysis and Trading Application's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

**Primary User: Individual Intraday Trader**
- Technical professionals with trading experience
- Focused on 1-15 minute trade durations
- Need real-time data analysis and automated strategy execution
- Require low-latency performance (sub-300ms)
- Comfortable with complex interfaces if they provide value

#### Usability Goals

- **Speed of execution**: Critical actions (order placement, position monitoring) must be accessible within 1-2 clicks
- **Real-time clarity**: Users can assess market conditions and strategy performance at a glance
- **Error prevention**: Clear visual distinction between live trading and paper trading modes
- **Risk awareness**: Position sizes, stop-losses, and risk metrics are always visible
- **Performance transparency**: System latency and data feed status are clearly indicated

#### Design Principles

1. **Performance First** - Every UI element optimized for the 300ms execution requirement
2. **Information Hierarchy** - Critical trading data takes visual precedence over secondary features
3. **Mode Clarity** - Live vs Paper vs Backtest modes are unmistakably distinct
4. **Risk Prominence** - Risk management controls are always visible and accessible
5. **Real-time Responsiveness** - UI updates reflect market changes without overwhelming the user

```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Top sidebar with mode switcher (Live/Paper/Backtest) and main sections (Strategies, Settings). Mode switching is the most critical navigation element as it determines the operational context.

**Secondary Navigation:** Panel management toolbar allowing users to show/hide, resize, and rearrange workbench panels. Each panel has its own internal navigation for specific features.

**Panel Management:**
- Drag-and-drop panel arrangement
- Panel docking and undocking
- Saved workspace layouts
- Quick panel toggles in toolbar

## User Flows

### Chart Analysis with Indicators

**User Goal:** Analyze market data using technical indicators to inform trading decisions

**Entry Points:**
- Main workbench Chart Panel
- Strategy development workflow
- Post-trade analysis review

**Success Criteria:** User can apply indicators, identify patterns, and make informed trading decisions within 30 seconds

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD

    J -->|Trade| L[Place order]
    J -->|Study| M[Save analysis]
    K --> N[End]
    L --> N
    M --> N
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Data feed interruption: Display clear warning, show last known data timestamp
- Indicator calculation errors: Show error message, suggest parameter adjustments
- Chart performance issues: Implement data throttling, reduce update frequency
- Invalid timeframe selection: Auto-correct to nearest valid timeframe

**Notes:** Chart performance is critical - implement smart rendering for high-frequency updates

    M --> E
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Strategy malfunction: Auto-disable with notification, preserve position data
- Risk limit breach: Immediate visual alerts, automated position reduction
- Data feed issues: Clear status indicators, fallback data sources
- Performance degradation: System load warnings, suggest optimization

**Notes:** Implement smart alerting to avoid notification fatigue while ensuring critical issues are highlighted

## Accessibility Requirements

### Compliance Target
**Standard:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with enhanced considerations for high-stress trading environments

### Key Requirements

**Visual:**
- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 minimum for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Focus indicators: 2px solid outline with high contrast colors
- Text sizing: Minimum 14px for interface text, scalable up to 200% without loss of functionality

**Interaction:**
- Keyboard navigation: Full keyboard access for all trading functions, logical tab order
- Screen reader support: Proper ARIA labels for dynamic content, live regions for price updates
- Touch targets: Minimum 44px for touch interfaces, adequate spacing between interactive elements

**Content:**
- Alternative text: Descriptive alt text for chart images, meaningful labels for data visualizations
- Heading structure: Logical heading hierarchy for screen reader navigation
- Form labels: Clear, descriptive labels for all form controls and trading inputs

### Testing Strategy
Regular accessibility audits using automated tools (axe-core) combined with manual testing and screen reader validation, with particular attention to real-time data updates and trading workflow accessibility

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | 320px | 767px | Phones (monitoring only) |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | Tablets (basic trading) |
| Desktop | 1024px | 1439px | Standard monitors |
| Wide | 1440px | - | Multiple monitors, ultrawide displays |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:** Mobile uses single-panel stack view, tablet allows 2-panel side-by-side, desktop enables full workbench layout with customizable panels

**Navigation Changes:** Mobile uses bottom tab bar, tablet/desktop use sidebar navigation, wide screens can accommodate persistent panels

**Content Priority:** Mobile shows only critical data (positions, alerts), tablet adds basic charts, desktop provides full feature set

**Interaction Changes:** Mobile uses swipe gestures for panel switching, touch-optimized controls, larger tap targets for critical actions

---

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles
**Performance-first animations:** All animations must not interfere with real-time data updates, use CSS transforms and opacity for optimal performance, respect user's reduced motion preferences

### Key Animations
- **Panel transitions:** Smooth slide-in/out animations (300ms, ease-out)
- **Data updates:** Subtle flash animations for price changes (200ms, ease-in-out)
- **Status changes:** Color transitions for connection status (150ms, linear)
- **Loading states:** Skeleton loaders for charts and data tables (infinite, ease-in-out)
- **Alert notifications:** Slide-down from top with bounce effect (400ms, ease-back)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** Initial workbench load under 2 seconds
- **Interaction Response:** UI interactions respond within 100ms
- **Animation FPS:** Maintain 60fps for all animations and real-time updates

### Design Strategies
Implement virtual scrolling for large data sets, use CSS containment for panel isolation, optimize chart rendering with canvas-based solutions, implement intelligent update batching to prevent UI thrashing during high-frequency data updates
